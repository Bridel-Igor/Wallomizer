# Wallomizer

This program will be useful for wallhaven.cc users but you can become one of them anyway.

With this program you can set slideshows from collections of pictures to run on background of your windows PC.
No more need to download wallpapers manually from wallhaven.cc or to choose which folder to set for slideshow now.
Collections can be chosen from any amount of local directories, wallhaven user collections or wallhaven search queues.

The goal was to make the smallest program with minimal possible performance consumption.
It was created on c++ using WinAPI and Wallhaven API.
