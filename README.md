# Wallomizer

This program will be useful for wallhaven.cc users but you can become one of them anyway.

This program allows You to set slideshows from collections of pictures to run on background of your windows PC.
No more need to download wallpapers manually from wallhaven.cc or to choose which folder to set for slideshow today.
The goal was to make the smallest program with minimal possible performance impact.
It was created on c++ using WinAPI and Wallhaven API.

Main features:
-Running slideshow on desktop background. Collections acts as source of pictures.
-Controlling slideshow properties and flow.
-Open the source of current wallpaper.
-Optional loading on startup.

There are the following types of collections:
1. Local collection.
Just a folder on your HDD or SSD.
2. Wallhaven user collection.
Wallpaper collections of wallhaven.cc users. Can be filtered by purity.
3. Wallhaven search result collection.
Result of a search queue in wallhaven.cc. Can be filtered by category, purity, resolution, aspect ratio, dominant color, tags.
You can add as many collections of these types as You want.
